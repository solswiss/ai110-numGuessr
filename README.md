# NumGuessr: Cafe Edition
Forked from *Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser*

**The Situation:** Someone asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit and I used AI agents to fix her up.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## Demo Walkthrough
1. User enters a guess of 1 → hint "Too Low"
2. User enters a guess of 50 → hint "Too High"
3. Score updates after each guess
4. Game ends after the correct guess or user exhausts tries
5. User starts a new game with difficulty selection

## Test Results

## 🚀 Stretch Features
Enhanced UI with Gemini; required a couple manual fixes
- recolor everything
- changed fonts
- cut the emojis, added context-appropriate kaomoji (I like the look ^^)
- added corner Rilakkuma
